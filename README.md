# Bad-Leonardo

Hey guys! This is the code I made to transform an Arduino Leonardo (Arduino micro works as well) into a "Rubber Ducky".
Follow for updates.

UPDATE: I wrote this when I was 12 years old so please excuse any faults you may find in regards to the code structure. The original arduino code is still uploaded, with all original comments and whatnot.
